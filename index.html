                My name is Joseph Dengler, and I am a developer - automation technician with a background in IIoT, embedded 
                systems, and programming. This portfolio showcases my capstone work for CS-499 at Southern New Hampshire University, 
                where I have applied my expertise in software engineering, data structures, and database management to enhance 
                real-world applications. Throughout this project, I refined two key artifacts—Nuoro Weight-Tracking App and 
                Grazioso Salvare Dashboard—by improving code quality, optimizing performance, and implementing 
                best practices in secure development throughout three enhancement projects. Explore the enhancements to see how 
                each application was improved to meet industry standards.

    <h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>

    <p>
        Throughout my coursework in the Computer Science with concentration in Software Engineering Undergraduate program at 
        Southern New Hampshire University, I have developed a comprehensive understanding of key computing principles and 
        industry best practices. Completing this capstone project and assembling another ePortfolio that strictly reflects 
        my studies here at SNHU. My Professional portfolio can be found here [] which includes many of my projects from work,
        SNHU, and just having fun! This portfolio highlights my ability to design, implement, and enhance real-world applications 
        while emphasizing efficiency, security, and scalability.
    </p>

    <p>
        My experience in the program has strengthened my problem-solving skills, structured thinking, and ability to 
        work within collaborative development environments. Each project built upon the last, reinforcing my ability to 
        analyze software challenges, implement robust solutions, and communicate effectively with both technical and 
        non-technical stakeholders.
    </p>

    <h3>Key Competencies and Strengths</h3>

    <h4>Collaborating in a Team Environment</h4>
    <p>
        Working in various team-based projects throughout the program has enhanced my ability to collaborate effectively 
        using Agile methodologies, Git version control, and code reviews. I have experience with feature branching, 
        resolving merge conflicts, and ensuring maintainability in team-driven development workflows.
    </p>

    <h4>Communicating with Stakeholders</h4>
    <p>
        Effective communication is essential in software development. I have worked on projects that required 
        writing technical documentation, gathering requirements from stakeholders, and presenting technical concepts 
        to non-technical audiences. My ability to explain complex programming logic clearly ensures smooth project 
        collaboration.
    </p>

    <h4>Data Structures & Algorithms</h4>
    <p>
        A solid foundation in data structures and algorithms has allowed me to develop optimized and scalable solutions. 
        Through hands-on implementation, I have worked extensively with sorting algorithms, tree structures, and database 
        query optimizations. This expertise was particularly useful in my work on enhancement two, where I improved the 
        efficiency of data retrieval in the Nuoro Weight-Tracking App by refactoring database queries.
    </p>

    <h4>Software Engineering & Databases</h4>
    <p>
        The development of my portfolio involved refining two major software artifacts: 
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nuoro Weight-Tracking Application (Enhancements 1 & 2) – A mobile application where I 
            implemented UI/UX improvements, introduced data validation, and optimized database performance.</li>
        <li>Grazioso Salvare Dashboard (Enhancement 3) – A MongoDB-powered dashboard where I 
            secured credentials, improved database indexing, and implemented structured error handling.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These projects required working with object-oriented design principles, RESTful API integration, and real-time 
        data visualization.
    </p>

    <h4>Security & Best Practices</h4>
    <p>
        Security is a critical component of software development. Throughout my coursework, I have implemented secure 
        authentication methods, data encryption, and input validation techniques to prevent vulnerabilities such as 
        SQL injection and XSS attacks. My work on database security in the Grazioso Salvare Dashboard focused on 
        replacing hardcoded credentials with environment variables, improving error handling, and ensuring data integrity.
    </p>

    <h3>Portfolio Overview</h3>
    <p>
        This portfolio demonstrates my ability to develop, enhance, and maintain software solutions that are efficient, 
        scalable, and secure. The three enhancements included in this capstone reflect my proficiency in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enhancement 1: Software Engineering & Design (Nuoro App – UI/UX, interactivity, input validation)</li>
        <li>Enhancement 2: Algorithms & Data Structures (Nuoro App – Query optimizations, sorting, filtering)</li>
        <li>Enhancement 3: Databases (Grazioso Dashboard – Secure database indexing, structured exception handling)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        By integrating my knowledge in software engineering, data structures, and security best practices, 
        this portfolio serves as a comprehensive representation of my technical and analytical abilities. 
        I am confident that these skills will allow me to excel in the software development field and 
        contribute effectively to any engineering team.
